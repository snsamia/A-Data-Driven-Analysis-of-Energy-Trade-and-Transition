# Energy Usage in Germany: An Exploratory Data Analysis

This project provides a comprehensive exploratory analysis of energy usage in Germany, focusing on trends, energy transitions, and sustainability. Using data from [Our World in Data](https://github.com/owid/energy-data), it visualizes key energy metrics to uncover insights into renewable and non-renewable energy usage, carbon intensity, and energy efficiency.

## üìÑ **Objective**
- Analyze Germany's energy consumption trends over the years.
- Compare Germany's energy metrics with the European Union (27).
- Examine the transition from non-renewable to renewable energy sources.
- Explore the relationship between energy consumption and GDP.
- Provide actionable insights for sustainable energy transitions.

## üîë **Key Insights**
1. **Renewable Energy Growth**:
   - Germany's renewable energy consumption has shown exponential growth over the years, driven by solar and wind energy.

2. **Non-Renewable Energy Decline**:
   - Coal, oil, and gas consumption have decreased, reflecting Germany's commitment to sustainable energy practices.

3. **Carbon Intensity Trends**:
   - A steady decline in carbon intensity, indicating cleaner electricity production.

4. **Energy Efficiency**:
   - Energy consumption per unit of GDP has improved, highlighting economic growth with reduced energy dependency.

5. **Comparative Analysis**:
   - Germany outpaces the EU (27) in renewable energy adoption but still trails in reducing fossil fuel dependency.
